/*
 * IRremote: IRsendRawDemo - demonstrates sending IR codes with sendRaw
 * An IR LED must be connected to Arduino PWM pin 3. (Defualt configuration for UNO class Arduinos)
 * Version 0.1 July, 2009
 * Copyright 2009 Ken Shirriff
 * http://arcfn.com
 *
 * IRsendRawFlash - added by AnalysIR (via www.AnalysIR.com), 11 April 2016
 *
 * This example shows how to send a RAW signal, from flash instead of SRAM, using the IRremote library.
 *
 * It is more efficient to use the sendNEC style function to send NEC signals.
 * Use of sendRaw_Flash here, serves only as an example of using the function to save SRAM with RAW signals.
 * 
 * Typical Uses: Allows users to store a significant number of signals in flash for sending, without using up SRAM.
 *               This is particularly important for sending RAW AC signal. Typically only one or 2 AC signals could be stored in SRAM using the traditional sendRAW function.
 *               With this function a large number of RAW AC signals can be stored & sent from Flash on a standard Arduino, with no material SRAM overhead.
 *               For even more Flash & signal storage, consider using a Mega1280/2560 with 128K/256K of available Flash vs the standard of 32k bytes.
 *
 * SRAM usage: On the Author's dev system the Arduino IDE 1.6.8 reported only 220 SRAM usage & 8,052 bytes of Flash storage used for this sketch.
 *             In contrast, only one of the signals below will fit on a standard UNO using the example sendRAW function of IRremote (using SRAM to store the signal)
